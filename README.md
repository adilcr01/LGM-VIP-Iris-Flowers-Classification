## Task 1: Iris Flowers Classification ML Project

Problem Statement: This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

Solution: Used sklearn.datasets iris flower dataset to train the model using Logistic Regression. In this dataset there are 150 samples containing following features:

    Sepal width
    Sepal length
    Petal width
    Petal length

Using the above 4 features classified a flower in 3 categories

    Setosa
    Versicolour
    Verginica
